\section{Aim of the study}
Highlighting the nestedness structure of the bipartite network representing correlations between methylated DNA sited and RNAs.
\section{Methods and Data}
\subsection{Nestedness}
Nested structures appear in the nature such that in ecological and socio-economic systems. In ecological systems, for instance, there is a nested distribution of species habitats. Where as some species only live in particular locations, some others live in a large variety of environments including those particular locations. In the context of network theory, a perfectly nested structure is such that for any pair of node ($i,j$) with $k_{i} < k_{j}$ their respective degree (number of neighbors), the set of nodes $i$ is interacting with is included in the set of nodes $j$ is interacting with. The adjacency matrix of such a network shows a triangular shape when columns and rows are sorted accordingly to the degree ordering of respective nodes. There are many metrics (other than degrees) permitting to infer the nested structure of a given network. Nestedness can appear in unipartite and bipartite networks. In the context of economical systems, especially the world trade network seen as a country-product bipartite network, recent research shows the existence of nestedness, see a complete review in \cite{mariani19}. In the context of biological systems nestedness structures have also been studied. In \cite{cantor17} different biological scales are considered. However, it seems that DNA-RNA interactions have not been studied yet. We choose the metric called fitness-complexity introduced in \cite{tacchella12} to investigate the nestedness structure of DNA-RNA bipartite network. Fitness and complexity is a non-linear and iterative algorithm permitting to infer the nestedness in bipartite network such as economical networks. In this context, the fitness is a country quality, and complexity is a product quality. In our approach we try to make an analogy where RNAs play the role of products and DNAs the role of countries. Here are the economical definitions of fitness and complexity.
\paragraph{Fitness and Complexity metrics}
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
F^{(n)}_{d} =  \sum_{r} B_{dr}Q^{(n-1)}_{r}\\
Q^{(n)}_{r} =  (\frac{1}{\sum_{d}B_{dr}\frac{1}{(F^{(n-1)}_{c})^{\gamma}}})^{1/\gamma}
\end{matrix}
\right.
\end{equation}
with $B_{dr}$ an element of the bi-adjacency matrix representing the correlation (positive or negative) interaction between a Methylated DNA $d$ and an RNA $r$, $F^{(n)}$ and $Q^{(n)}$ the Fitness and Complexity vector measured at iteration $n$. We set $\gamma$ to $2$.
\paragraph{Product's complexity}
\subsection{Data}
We used an open access cancer dataset from GDC Data Portal. From raw data consisting in methylated DNA and RNA's beta-values for up to 841 tumorous and normal breast tissues, we built a Matrix of Pearson Correlation Coefficients between Methylated DNA and RNA from these beta-values. A network representing the Pearson correlation coefficients between pairs (M-DNA,RNA) consists in a bipartite graph with coefficients as weight of the links containing. We also project DNAs into spacial clusters of length 40K base-pairs, this turns $N_{DNA} = 364285$ DNAs into a set of $N_{cl} = 93690$ clusters. The nature of correlations are either positive or negative.

We propose to measure complexity of RNAs from the complexity-fitness metric proposed in \cite{tacchella12}.
